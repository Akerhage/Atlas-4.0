# Atlas 4.0 — Refactoring Documentation

Branch: `daniel/refactoring`
Started: 2026-03-29

This document tracks all structural changes made during the refactoring of Atlas 4.0.

---

## Overview

The goal of this branch is to modernize the Atlas frontend from vanilla JavaScript to a React + TypeScript application, while preserving all existing functionality and visual design.

---

## Phase 1: Frontend Migration (Renderer → React)

### What was done

The entire `Renderer/` directory (vanilla JS frontend) is being replaced by a new `client/` directory containing a React + Vite + TypeScript application.

### Architecture Changes

| Before | After | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Vanilla JS with `<script defer>` tags | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite | Modern component architecture, type safety, better DX |
| Global namespace (`window.*` functions) | ES modules with imports | Proper encapsulation, no name collisions |
| Manual view switching (`display: none/flex`) | React Router | Standard SPA routing with URL support |
| Global `State` object + `localStorage` | React Context (Auth, Socket, Theme) | Predictable state management, reactive updates |
| Dual IPC/HTTP code paths (`ipc-bridges.js`) | Single HTTP API layer (`services/api.ts`) | Eliminated redundant Electron IPC middleman |
| Socket.IO loaded dynamically with retry | Socket.IO client via npm + context | Proper dependency management |
| CSS in `Renderer/assets/css/` | CSS copied to `client/src/styles/` | Same CSS, new location |
| Static assets in `Renderer/assets/` | Static assets in `client/public/assets/` | Vite serves from `public/` |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dropped Electron IPC layer** — The app now uses HTTP fetch exclusively. Electron becomes a thin wrapper that loads the web app URL. This eliminates `ipc-bridges.js`, `preload.js`, `preload-loader.js` and the dual code paths.

2. **Preserved CSS as-is** — `style.css` (148K) is imported globally without modification to ensure visual fidelity. Same class names are used in React components.

3. **Critical color system preserved exactly** — `getAgentStyles()` with its priority order (office → agent → currentUser → fallback) is ported verbatim. Output keys `{main, bg, tagBg, bubbleBg, border}` are unchanged.

4. **Vite dev proxy** — During development, Vite proxies `/api`, `/team`, `/search_all`, and `/socket.io` to `localhost:3001` so the React dev server works alongside the existing backend.

5. **React Context over Redux** — Auth, Socket, and Theme state managed via React Context. Lightweight, sufficient for this app's state complexity.

6. **Playwright E2E tests** — New test suite in `client/e2e/` targeting the React app. Tests cover authentication, navigation, view rendering, tab switching, and UI state. Uses Vite dev server via `webServer` config for local runs, or `ATLAS_E2E_BASE_URL` for remote targets.

## Phase 2: Backend Refactoring (Planned, paused)

Backend TypeScript migration and restructuring was planned but is paused because the vitest tests + TS migration was done on another machine and the branch wasn't pushed.

Planned structure:
```
server/
├── server.ts
├── db.ts
├── legacy_engine.ts
├── routes/
├── middleware/
├── utils/
└── patch/
```

---

## What Has NOT Changed

- `server.js` — untouched
- `db.js` — untouched
- `routes/` — untouched
- `middleware/` — untouched
- `utils/` — untouched
- `patch/` — untouched
- `knowledge/` — untouched
- `kundchatt/` — untouched
- `e2e/` — untouched
- `main.js` — untouched (Electron main process)
- All backend logic — untouched

---

## Remaining Work

- [x] Migrate Admin sub-views (13 modules) — 12 React components in `views/Admin/`
- [x] Migrate shared components — ConfirmModal, AssignModal, NotesModal, NotifBell, BroadcastModal
- [x] Ticket detail panel — TicketDetail with messages, reply, claim/assign/archive/delete actions
- [x] Profile settings modal — ProfileModal with avatar/color/status/password
- [x] Mail composer modal — MailComposer with external/internal mode toggle
- [x] Playwright e2e tests — auth, navigation, views (3 spec files)
- [x] Bulk operations in Inbox — multi-select with checkboxes, floating toolbar, batch claim/archive
- [x] Update `server.js` — serves `client/dist/` with fallback to `Renderer/`, SPA catch-all route
- [x] Update `main.js` — loads `http://localhost:3001` instead of `file://`, removed preload dependency
- [x] Mobile hamburger menu — toggle sidebar, overlay backdrop, responsive layout
- [ ] Quill rich text editor integration for Templates
- [ ] E2E test updates for deployed environment
